# Sokoban Clone
Sokoban clone with level editor and the ability to generate levels at random.

Run:
```
javac Start.java
```

And then:
```
java Start
```

The point of the game is to move the jars to the tiles with gems inside them. When every gem tile has a jar on top of it, you will advance to the next level.
